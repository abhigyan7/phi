Phi is a simple interpreter for a Lisp-y language, written in C99. I built it following the [Build your own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com/) book. Phi primarily differs from the intepreter built in the book in that it has an explicit boolean type. I might add a few more things to Phi in the future. 

## Compiling
1. Run `make prep` to create the release and debug output directories.
2. Run `make release` or `make debug` to build the build you want.
